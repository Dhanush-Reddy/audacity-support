## Cut, Copy and Paste buttons

The **Cut**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons have been removed from the **Edit Toolbar** in version 3.2.0.

* In the **Edit menu**, choose Cut/Copy/Paste
* Use **shortcuts**:&#x20;
  * `Ctrl+X` is cut (`Cmd+X` on macOS)
  * `Ctrl+C` is copy (`Cmd+C` on macOS)
  * `Ctrl+V` is paste (`Cmd+V` on macOS)
