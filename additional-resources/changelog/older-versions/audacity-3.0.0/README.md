Full details of new features in the visual guide to [new-features-in-audacity-3.0.0.md](new-features-in-audacity-3.0.0.md "mention")

### Supported Platforms

**Windows**

* Audacity 3.0.0 requires the CPU to support the [SSE2 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2)instruction set which should be available on any Intel hardware produced after 2001 and any AMD hardware produced after 2003.
  * To check what SSE levels your CPU supports, you can install [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html).
  * If your hardware only supports SSE, you may download Audacity 2.0.6 see the [Legacy Windows](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/legacy-windows/) page on the Audacity Website.
* 3.0.0 does not support Windows XP.
  * You may try 2.2.2 on XP, but it is unsupported.

**macOS / Mac OS X**

* Audacity 3.0.0 is for Intel Macs running OS X 10.7 and later and macOS.
  * There are legacy versions for older OS X at [http://audacityteam.org/download/legacy-mac/](http://audacityteam.org/download/legacy-mac/).

**Linux**

* Linux support is tested on Ubuntu Linux.
  * Audacity may compile on Gentoo, Debian, Mint.
  * Audacity does not currently compile on SuSE Linux.

### Interactive Buglist Page

_We probably track more bugs than you are interested in..._

On the dynamic buglist page you can select to view:

* Complete list of bugs in 2.4.2 that we have fixed for 3.0.0
* Known bugs on the OS you use Mac, Windows or Linux.
* Known bugs to do with accessibility or localization.
* Workarounds for some bugs.
* Serious bugs and less serious bugs.

You can choose various combinations of these. However, there are probably too many minor bugs and too much detail on that [dynamic buglist page](broken-reference) for most users.

We **do** use this detail in our own QA work.

### Highlighted Issues

* Below are listed what we believe are the most common and important issues with 3.0.0 for most users.

**Accessibility**

* Less of Audacity is properly accessible to visually impaired users than we would like. Currently the best supported platform for accessibility is Windows. We lost a lot of custom accessibility programming when we had to move to a more recent version of the wxWidgets library.

**Internationalization**

* Audacity is only partially translated in many languages. We also have some issues, for example, with Right-To-Left Languages.
